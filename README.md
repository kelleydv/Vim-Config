# Vim-Config
Just some personal configs, borrowed colorschemes, etc.
My settings are biased towards writing Python.

### How to Use
The easiest way to use these files, supposing you are new
to vim, is to copy this repo to your computer and type the
following in a terminal

```
$ cd Vim-Config
$ ./repo_to_home_copy.sh
```
